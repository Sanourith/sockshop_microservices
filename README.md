# Project Sockshop on CI/CD

Hello,

I'm working on Sockshop app ;\
To be able to create a full CI/CD I pushed all those folders into private Gitlab repositories.

Each folder contains microservices files, which can be used on Gitlab's Pipeline thanks to .gitlab-ci.yml file.

Goes with [my AWS infrastructure plan](https://github.com/Sanourith/terraform_sockshop).
